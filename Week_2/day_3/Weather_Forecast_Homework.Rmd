#Question 1

```{r}
weather_forcast <- list(
                  "Thursday" = list(temperature = 8, chance_of_rain = 14, wind_speed = 21),
                  "Friday" = list(temperature = 11, chance_of_rain = 30, wind_speed = 44),
                  "Saturday" = list(temperature = 11, chance_of_rain = 10, wind_speed = 16)
)
```

# Question 2

```{r}
day <- c('Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday')
temperature <- c(8, 11, 11)
chance_of_rain <- c(14, 30, 10)
wind_speed <- c(21, 44, 16)
weather_forcast <- tibble (temperature, chance_of_rain, wind_speed)
tibble(temperature, chance_of_rain, wind_speed) %>% 

```

i) 14
ii) 44
iii) 8

# Question 3

```{r}
